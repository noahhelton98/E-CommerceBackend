# E-CommerceBackend

## Description 
A back end application that uses sequelize to interact with an e-commerce MySQL Database. This program can create, read, update, and delete categories, products, and tags from the database. 

## User Story 
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## Demo and usage
A demonstration video can be found in the demo folder. This video displays how to set up your database, seed it, and then use insomnia to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE from the categories section - however it works for all routes (tags, categories, and products), but categories was used as an example.
